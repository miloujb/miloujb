- 👋 Hi, I’m Emily, but you can call me @miloujb if you like! I'm a software developer based between Staffordshire and Manchester.
- 👀 I originally trained as a linguist, specialising in translation, before I moved to software development two years ago. I speak fluent French, Spanish and German, as well as some Danish, Italian and Catalan.
- ✈️ I love to travel, and I have a goal to visit every European capital before my 30th birthday, which gives me just under three years to complete my list. I also have plans to travel around both North and South America. 
- 🎼 Talk to me about music! I play the piano, guitar, bass, mandolin, ukulele and cajon, and I'm always looking for something else to learn.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, but I'm also interested in TypeScript, Swift, Dart... and the list goes on!
