- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Emily, but you can call me @miloujb if you like! I'm a software developer based between Staffordshire and Manchester.
- ðŸ‘€ I originally trained as a linguist, specialising in translation, before I moved to software development two years ago. I speak fluent French, Spanish and German, as well as some Danish, Italian and Catalan.
- ðŸŽ¼ Talk to me about music! I play the piano, guitar, bass, mandolin, ukulele and cajon, and I'm always looking for something else to learn.
